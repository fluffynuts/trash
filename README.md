# trash
A small utility written in Rust to quickly trash files or dirs

# WARNING
This will trash whatever paths it's given, no hesitation, no feedback

# Why?
Because `rm -rf node_modules` on a windows box takes approximately forever. This doesn't.
Also, I wanted to learn some Rust, and I learn by doing -- so I've made something I can
use and gained a little Rust XP. Win-Win.

# How to use?

`trash.exe {path1} ... {path2 ..}`

# What does it trash?

Files, dirs

# ALL MAH SHIT IS GONE, YO!

I warned you above. Use at your own peril.
